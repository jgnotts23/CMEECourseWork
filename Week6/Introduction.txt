#### Introduction to Genomics ####

Genomics -> Transcriptomics -> Proteomics -> Epigenomics -> Cistromics

Sources of DNA and RNA
- RNA much more sensitive 
- Invasive sampling: biopsy darts, tissue, blood, roots, etc.
- Non invasive sampling: faeces, saliva, urine, etc.
- Environmental DNA: water, soil, etc.

Genomics
- Types of genomes (mitochondrial, plastid, nuclear)
- Types of genes (coding, ribosomal, etc.)
- Types of sequencing platform (MiSeq, HiSeq, Pacbio)
- Type of reads (paired-end, single end, short, long)
- Difficulties with combining short and long reads

N50 - an important metric for genome assembly. Defined as the minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome. It means, half of the genome sequence is in contigs larger than or equal to the N50 contig size


Metagenomics/Metabarcoding
- In metabarcoding, read numbers is roughly proportional to species abundance
- Mitochondrial DNA used for barcoding animals
- Plastid DNA used for barcoding plants

Transcriptomics and RNA-seq
- Differential gene expression: read numer is proportional to level of expression, usually represented with heat map and Venn diagram
- Positive selection which is identified by calculating the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions; usually shown on protein 3D structure


### Case Study: Ecological Genomics ###

Lord Howe Island
Two palm species:
- Kentia or Thatch palm: grow anywhere
- Curly Palm: volcanic soils
- The two species are fully sympatric in 20% of their distribution
- Reproductive isolation through flowering time differences
- Believed to be derived from a recent ancestor species

Tests the 4 criteria of sympatric spectation:
- Sympatry: random quadrats on 71 locations
- Sistership: phylogeny of all palms based on multiple genes and fossil calibration
- Reproductive isolation
- Allopatry unlikely
