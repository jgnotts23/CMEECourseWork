ML question - very similar to practicals
Evolutionary modelling - focus on Tim's stuff only

Bayesian:
- Parameters are random in nature, follow another pdf (with hyper parameters)
- Can incorporate prior knowledge
- Inference based on posterior distribution (= prior x likelihood (or evidence))
- Posterior is a pdf (area = 1)
- Point estimates: posterior mean/median
- Confidence interval and its interpretation from quantiles of the posterior (e.g. 2.5% and 97.5%, "95% chance that the true parameters lie within the C.I.)
- More incoming data: current posterior can act as prior for new observations
- Hypothesis testing: Bayes factor

Classical (MLE):
- Parameters are fixed but unknown (real numbers, non-random)
- Cannot incorporate prior knowledge
- Inference based solely on likelihood function
- Likelihood is not a pdf (area != 1)
- Point estimates: points where the log-likelihood function is maximised
- Confidence interval and its interpretation: 2 (or 0.5 x X^2k for k parameters) units below the peak of the log-likelihood. Parameters are numbers, its logically flawed to make any probabalistic statements on numbers. Therefore, "If i repeat the experiment for many many times and obtain many many C.I.s, then 05% of those C.I.s will have the true parameters covered.
- More incoming data: recalculate the whole thing
- Hypothesis testing: likelihood-ratio test for nested models

Equivalence: Bayesian with a uniform prior = Likelihood

Markov chain
- A random process, series of random variables
- There are several states (possible outcomes)
- Transits between states by chance over time
- Memoryless - transition prob only depend on current state
- Trans prob can be represented in Markob matrix
- Time-homogenous Marov chain: a special time of Markov chain whose transition prob remains same over time

JC69 substitution model
- Can be modelled with Markov matrices
- Nucleotide substitution, mutation into one of four states

Wright-Fisher model as Markov chain
- For diploids, if effective pop size is N, the possible number of alleles (states) are {0:2N}
- two alleles A and B
- dimension of matrix is (2N+1)^2
- Genetic drift changes allele freq over generations
- If freq of allele A is k/2N now, number of allele A in next gen follows binomial(2N, k/2N)

Markov matrix probs:
- non-negative
- row sum to one
- If markov matrix M is time-homogenous, then the transitin probs for T steps ahead is M^T
- we can analyse long-term behaviour of M, some have limiting distrib
