Microbial communities provide many ecosystem services/disservices

# Human gut
- shit loads of species
- more bacterial cells than human cells
- predominantly anaerobic environment
- bacteria distinct from other human bacteria, largely due to conditions
- aid in biodegradation of complex sugars
- ferment sugars to short chain fatty acids which the human uses in muscle, heart and brain
- variation in gut communities throughout the world
- some evidence the host uses cells to 'sample' the gut and alter anti-microbials as a result
- succession observed through adolescence
- diet has a bit effect on composition
