_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     These functions provide information about the uniform distribution
     on the interval from ‘min’ to ‘max’.  ‘dunif’ gives the density,
     ‘punif’ gives the distribution function ‘qunif’ gives the quantile
     function and ‘runif’ generates random deviates.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dunif(x, min = 0, max = 1, log = FALSE)
     punif(q, min = 0, max = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
     qunif(p, min = 0, max = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
     runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    x, q: vector of quantiles.

       p: vector of probabilities.

       n: number of observations. If ‘length(n) > 1’, the length is
          taken to be the number required.

min, max: lower and upper limits of the distribution.  Must be finite.

log, log.p: logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).

lower.tail: logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X <= x],
          otherwise, P[X > x].

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If ‘min’ or ‘max’ are not specified they assume the default values
     of ‘0’ and ‘1’ respectively.

     The uniform distribution has density

                             f(x) = 1/(max-min)                         
     
     for min <= x <= max.

     For the case of u := min == max, the limit case of X == u is
     assumed, although there is no density in that case and ‘dunif’
     will return ‘NaN’ (the error condition).

     ‘runif’ will not generate either of the extreme values unless ‘max
     = min’ or ‘max-min’ is small compared to ‘min’, and in particular
     not for the default arguments.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     ‘dunif’ gives the density, ‘punif’ gives the distribution
     function, ‘qunif’ gives the quantile function, and ‘runif’
     generates random deviates.

     The length of the result is determined by ‘n’ for ‘runif’, and is
     the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the
     other functions.

     The numerical arguments other than ‘n’ are recycled to the length
     of the result.  Only the first elements of the logical arguments
     are used.

_N_o_t_e:

     The characteristics of output from pseudo-random number generators
     (such as precision and periodicity) vary widely.  See
     ‘.Random.seed’ for more information on R's random number
     generation algorithms.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘RNG’ about random number generation in R.

     Distributions for other standard distributions.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     u <- runif(20)
     
     ## The following relations always hold :
     punif(u) == u
     dunif(u) == 1
     
     var(runif(10000))  #- ~ = 1/12 = .08333
