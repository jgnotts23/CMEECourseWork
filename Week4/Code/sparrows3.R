# Continuous data is sampled from a normal distribution
# and its probability distribution is defined by mean and variance
## Log-normal is also continuous but measurements cannot be zero and 
## there is a positive relationship between mean and variance
## Exponentials are also continuous

# Binomial data is discrete with two possible outcomes
# Multinomial is discrete with multiple outcomes

# Count data - Poisson distribution, mean = variance
# e.g. clutch size, species number

# Categorical ranked data (e.g. young, middle-aged, old)
# Categorical nominal data (e.g. red, green, blue)
