- Excel
High-level

C++ probably most used of the C family nowadays.
C is a subset of C++.

Why use C?
- Speeds up calculations
- Create standalone exectuables (doesn't require interpreter)
- Access to bit-level
- Popular language, lots of support
- Improve understanding of machine level and optimisation
- Reading/using abundant C code in computational biology
