"Greenness" increasing over last 30 years, particularly in northern latitudes
- tracking using satellite data
- Microwave satellites can be used to track changes in biomass
- Tropical forests decreasing but temperate forests increasing
- GPP also increasing

Fires can also be tracked
- Decline in fires in some parts of Africa and Australia
- Modelling data doesn't support this

Vegetation dynamics modelled from climate data. Satellite data integrated too to optimise model. Many iterations reduce 'cost' of the model.

Pattern-oriented model evaluation (machine learning)
- Models predict that warm springs will produce warm summers and autumns but satellite data disagrees with this

Data-driven fire model proved more accurate than process-driven model.
