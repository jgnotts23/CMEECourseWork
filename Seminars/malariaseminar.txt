# Understanding the effectiveness of indoor based malaria vector control
########################################################################
- 48% reduction in mortality rates since 2000
- Primarily through distribution of insecticde treated bednets (ITNs)
- Number of cases decreases until 2013/14 but started to rise again since

- Pyrethroids are currently only class of insecticides used on bednets
- Mosquitoes are becoming increasingly resistant to the insecticide
- Resistance to one pyrethroid tends to mean resistant to all

- PBO LLIN nets more effective (and expensive) than standard LLIN nets
- PHASE II studies show bed nets can deter house entry by mosquitoes
- ~10% reduction in indoor biting rate over last 15 years, may reduce net effectiveness
