###### GIS Concepts ######
Geographic information systems (GIS)
- Niche form of database
- Still important but becoming less used 
- Used by conservationists, police, delivery drivers etc. 
- A way of creating, storing, manipulating, analysing and presenting geographic information
- Good for spatial comparisons

Any piece of data that can be located in space using:
- a set of coordinates
- a known coordinate system (both required)


### Spherical coordinates ###

Latitude is an angle above or below the equator:
- Points of equal latitude form a parallel
- Distance between parallels is constant
- Can be +/- 90 degrees

Longitude is an angle around the equator:
- Points of equal longitude form a meridian 
- Distance between meridians varies
- Can be +/- 180 degrees
- Degrees of longitude do not easily convert into distances due to spherical nature of the Earth

The Earth is not a perfect sphere which complicates longitude and latitude further
- Estimated reference ellipsoid (datums) vary
- WGS 1984 most commonly used
- This slight imperfection can actually skew coordinates quite significantly if not accounted for
- Unfortunately, the Earth isn't an ellipsoid either. Distribution of mass is uneven and dynamic

Geoid
- Surface of equal gravitational force
- Up and down are perpendicular to the local geoid
- A level surface is tangent to the local geoid

The Mason-Dixon Line
- Between Maryland and Pennsylvannia which separated slave-owning South and non-slave-owning North
- Huge operation to mark the line
- Thought to be accurate to 50 feet but in reality some parts are 900 feet out
- Local gravity caused by mountain ranges skewed their measurements

WGS 1984
- Combined datum and geoid giving standard global coordinate system
- Uses modern satellite data to provide ellipsoid measurements and gravity model
- Used by gps

Local geographic datum
- The fit between a geoid and a datum varies in space
- Global models like WGS 1984 work well on average
- Countries adopt local datum models that fit better locally
- British National Grid uses OSGB 36 datum
- Same latitude and longitude + different datum = datum shift
- In Cornwall the local datum is about 70m E and 70m S from WGS 1964

Spherical geometry
- Great circles
- Spherical 'triangle'
- Spherical geometry = exact and fast
- Ellipsoidal geometry = iterative and slow
- Hard to scale spheres and represent them on paper

Map projects can preserve:
- Shape: conformal maps
- Area: equal-area maps
- Distance
- Direction

But most projected coordinate systems can only preserve one of these ^^


### Data Types ###

Raster data
- An image covering a continuous surface
- Made up of individual pixels, each with a value
- Has a resolution (pixel size)
- Needs origin and coordinate system
- Categorical: e.g. land cover, species presence
- Continuous: e.g. temperature, canopy cover
- High resolution = big grid squares
- Values can be blank or 0

Vector data - a set of features, containing one of:
- Individual points
- Sets of connected points forming lines or polygons
- Needs a coordinate system
- Coordinates of points are a precise location, but may have precision or accuracy information
- Features may have an attribute table


### Remote Sensing ###

Mapping landscapes manually
- Very fine level of detail
- Expensive, slow and inconsistent

Maps from images
- Aerial photography (1900s)
- Satellite imagery (1950s)

Remote sensors can be:
- Passive: sense reflected solar radiation (e.g. photographs)
- Active: emit and sense reflections (e.g. light, microwaves). Detect alteration in reflected light.

LiDAR is popular currenly, very useful for forest mapping. Expensive as it requires an aeroplane and specialists/specialist equipment.

Reflectance
- Albedo: the proportion of radiation reflected from a surface (texture and angle strongly affect albedo)

Multispectral images
- The albedo of a surface varies with the wavelength of the radiation
- Different surfaces have different relectance profiles
- Composed of..

Satellite orbits
- High Earth geostationary orbits (weather)
- Mid Earth orbits (navigation and communications)
- Low Earth orbits (Earth observation) including sun synchronous orbit, controlling the time of day of observation

Spatiotemporal resolution
- Low Earth orbits:
- Close to the planet
- High spatial resolution
- Narrow path widths
- Small scenes
- Less frequent
- Satellite constellations can increase temporal resolution

Spectral resolution
- Determined by the satellite mission
- Constrained by absorption of radiation by the atmosphere
- Light gathering sets resolution and band width

Using satellite images
- Georeferencing: where is the image?
- Orthorectification: remove perspective and terrain effects
- Calibration: convert sensor value to an actual refectance value
- Atmospheric correction: aerosols and water vapour can all impose spectral biases on reflected light and vary on a daily basis

Vegetation indices
- Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (chlorophyll density)
- Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (leaf density)

Land cover
- Spectral signatures differ between different surfaces (e.g. soil, water and vegetation)
