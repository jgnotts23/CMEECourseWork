#### Food Web Structure and Dynamics Across Space and Time ####

Body size delimits the range of resources that a consumer can feasibly access and sets the rate of consumption. It also controls the flux, storage and turnover of energy and matter (as does stoichiometry).

There is great variation in the stoichiometry of organisms.
- Arthopods have high carbon and nitrogen levels in their exoskeletons
- Phosphorous is important in endoskeletons

N and P may be limiting elements in consumer-resource interactions.

Elemental imbalances in consumer-resource interactions seem to be common in nature.

One of the most pervasive human impacts on ecosystems is alteration of global nutrient budgets.
