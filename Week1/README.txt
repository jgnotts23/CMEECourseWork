### Description

This directory and its subsidaries contains the code created in week 1 of the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution MSc at Imperial College London. Some code was provided by my supervisor, Samraat Pawar, and the rest is original content. Subdirectories have been created entitled 'Code', 'Data', 'Results' and 'Sandbox'. 'Code' contains several bash scripts, a LaTex script, and some .txt files with additional code. 'Data' contains some data that was used to test some of the scripts and 'Results' is where any script outputs will appear. 'Sandbox' was created for practice purposes and can be ignored. The purpose of this project was to learn basic UNIX coding, learn how to use GIT and to learn the basics of LaTex.

### Code

> boilerplate.sh
A basic shell script to act as a template for more complex scripts. Created to learn proper formatting with a simple output to show it works. "This is a shell script" should appear in the terminal if successful.

> CompileLaTex.sh
A bash script to compile a LaTex document with references. Output will appear in the 'Results' directory.

> ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh
A bash script to concatenate (merge) the contents of two files.

> CountLines.sh
A bash script to count the number of lines in a file. Output will appear in the terminal.

> csvtospace.sh
A bash script to convert a comma-separated-file (CSV) to a tab-separated-file (TSV). Output should appear in the same directory as the original file.

> FirstBiblio.bib
A file containing a reference for the LaTex example.

> FirstExample.tex
A file containing the code for a LaTex document.

> MyExampleScript.sh
A bash script illustrating the use of the 'echo' function. Output will appear in the terminal.

> tabtocsv.sh
A bash script to subsitute the tabs in a file with commas. Output will appear in the same directory with a .csv extension.

> tiff2png.sh
A bash script to convert a .tiff image to a .png image

> UnixPrac1.txt
A series of lines of code to answer the problems in the FASTA practical set by S. Pawar. Each line of code will answer the question it is related to. An E.coli.fasta file was used to test the code and is located in the 'Data' directory. Outputs will appear in the terminal.

> variables.sh
A bash script to illustrate the use of variables in UNIX. Outputs will appear in the terminal.


### Dependencies

Everything in this project was created and run with the ubuntu 16.04 OS.
Most of the code was either entered directly into the UNIX terminal or saved as a shell script created in Visual Studio Code 1.27.2
