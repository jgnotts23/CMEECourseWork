\section{Neutral Theory}

\subsection{Question 8}
Despite no species having superior fitness in a neutral model, 
the system will always converge to monodominance
as time elapses. This is because as a species becomes more
numerous by chance, they now have a higher probability of 
being selected by the model to replace the removed individual at
the next neutral step. This advantage will perpetuate until only 
one species remains.
