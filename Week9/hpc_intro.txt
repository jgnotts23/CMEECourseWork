##### Ecological Neutral Theory #####

Assumes all individuals are ecologically equivalent.

Misconceptions
- not the same as a null model
- does not assume all species are the same
- a model in which species are interchangeable is neutral

So what does it mean?
- The demographic properties of an individual are independent of its species diversity

Voter model (1975)
- purpose was to determine how people would vote
	- pick random neighbour (not far away)
	- you take their view or they take yours at random
	- Keep going for a while and see what happens
	- Patches of one colour formed (analagous to politics?)
- replace voting intention with a species and people with a habitat and this model can be applied to biology
- What we found
	- found some impenetrable clumps forming
	- there are edge effects
	- eventually everyone in each connceted group holds the same view
	- can introduce mutation (new colour) but likely to be outcompeted

Model rules in brief:
- In each timestep individuals die and are replaced with the offspring of another individual
- Sometimes a new species is dropped in instead of an offspring of an exisiting species
- Zero sum assumption is that an individual has to die for a new offspring to spawn, can be relaxed
- Speciation can be introduced through a single individual or several (i.e. migration) or through protracted speciation which is mutations within some organisms that survive and spread and form new species (i.e. more biological)
- spatial structure can be implemented by defining patch size (e.g. continent to island) or using dispersal kernel which uses a probability curve that dispersal will occur relative to the distance from the individual (less likely further away but still possible)

Applications in island biogeography
- MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography (1967) which factors in immigration and extinction
