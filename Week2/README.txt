README - CMEE Coursework Week 2

### Description ###

This directory and its subsidaries contains the code created in week 2 of the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution MSc at Imperial College London. Some code was provided by my supervisor, Samraat Pawar, and the rest is original content. Subdirectories have been created entitled 'Code', 'Data', 'Results' and 'Sandbox'. 'Code' contains several python scripts. 'Data' contains some data that was used to test some of the scripts and 'Results' is where any script outputs will appear. 'Sandbox' was created for practice purposes and can be ignored. The purpose of this project was to learn basic python coding.

### Code ###

> align_seqs.py
A program that takes sequence data inputs from a csv file and finds the alignment with the highest score, outputting the result to a text file.

> basic_csv.py
A simple script to demonstrate how to read and write csv files with python.

> basic_io.py
A basic script to demonstrate how to input and output files with python. Also demonstrates how to store objects for later use using pickle.

> boilerplate.py
A simple boilerplate to demonstrate python basics and how to structure script files.

> cfexercises1.py
Some exercises to practice the use of control statements.

> cfexercises2.py
Another program to practice the use of control statements. Will take arguments from the user as well as existing test arguments.

> control_flow.py
A program with some fuctions exemplifying the use of control statements in python.

> debugme.py
A program demonstrating how bugs can form in a script

> dictionary.py
A demonstration of how to create a dictionary and map it to a specified key.

> lc1.py
A demonstration of the use of loops and list comprehensions to output data from a tuple of tuples.

> lc2.py
A further demonstration of the use of loops and list comprehensions to output data from a tuple of tuples with if statements.

> loops.py
Some functions to practice the use of loops.

> oaks.py
Exercise to practice the use of loops and list comprehensions. Involves finding oak trees within a list of taxa.

> oaks_debugme.py
A program that identifies oaks from a list of taxa. A bug was initially present but has been removed and doctests have been added to test the functions.

> scope.py
A program to demonstrate the difference between local and global variables.

> sysargv.py
A program to demonstrate the function of sys.argv in python.

> test_control_flow.py
A program to exemplify the use of doctesting.

> tuple.py
A funtcion that outputs a list of data from a tuple of tuples

> using_name.py
A program to demonstrate how a file can be used both as a script and an importable module


### Dependencies ###

Everything in this project was created and run with the ubuntu 16.04 OS.
Most of the code was either entered directly into the UNIX terminal or saved as a shell script created in Visual Studio Code 1.27.2. Python scripts were run in ipython 3.5.2.
